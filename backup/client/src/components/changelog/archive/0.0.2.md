### Summary

#### New features:

* Changelog files are now parsed and displayed to the public.
* Added donation feature to the account menu.

#### Bug fixes:

* 'fs' module was not being used properly, because Next.js only allows the use of this module in
  the `getServerSideComponents`.

#### Improvements:

* Added a loading spinner in the home page.
* ResultCards are more responsive also for mobile use.
