#
# Executors have a:
# - name                The executor's name.
# - corePoolSize        The minimum number of threads.
# - maxPoolSize         The maximum number of threads.
# - keepAliveTime       The time in seconds, time to keep idle threads alive.
# - maxPendingRequests  The maximum number of requests to queue before creating threads outside the core pool.
#
# Note, when setting maxPendingRequests to zero the behaviour of async will become synchronous when all threads are in use.
#
# Advice for now is to keep maxPendingRequests at '1' and corePoolSize and maxPoolSize the same.
